- Integrated routing at `/admin/patch-management`
- Professional error handling and loading states

### 3. File System Structure

**Organized Directory Structure:**
```
patches/
├── releases/           # Generated patch JSON files
├── templates/          # Patch templates for future use
├── archive/           # Archived historical patches
├── missing-features.md # Comprehensive feature documentation
├── version.json       # Current version tracking
├── CHANGELOG.md       # Automated changelog generation
