```typescript
import { createNebulaForgeEngine } from '@nebulaforge/engine';
import { BaseGameExpansion } from '@nebulaforge/expansion-base-game';
import { StellarConquestExpansion } from '@nebulaforge/expansion-stellar-conquest';

const engine = createNebulaForgeEngine(config);
await engine.initialize();

// Load expansions
const baseGame = new BaseGameExpansion(engine);
await engine.loadExpansion(baseGame);

const stellarConquest = new StellarConquestExpansion(engine);
await engine.loadExpansion(stellarConquest);

await engine.start();
```

### Advanced Multi-Expansion Setup

for (const { name, config } of expansions) {
  const ExpansionClass = await import(`@nebulaforge/expansion-${name}`);
  const expansion = new ExpansionClass.default(engine, config);
  await engine.loadExpansion(expansion);
}
```
