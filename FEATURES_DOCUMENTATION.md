### Core MMO Systems

#### Resource Management System
The economy is built around four fundamental resources that drive all game activities:

**Metal** - Primary construction material
- Extracted by Metal Mines on planetary surfaces
- Base production: 30 units/hour at level 1
- Used for: Building construction, ship hulls, basic infrastructure
- Production scales with mine level using formula: `baseProduction * (1.1 ^ level)`
- Cost scaling: `baseCost * (1.5 ^ (level-1))`

**Crystal** - Advanced technology component
- Harvested by Crystal Mines from rare mineral deposits
- Base production: 20 units/hour at level 1
- Used for: Advanced buildings, ship electronics, research facilities
- More scarce than metal, essential for technological advancement
- Required for all high-tier research projects

**Deuterium** - Fuel and energy source
- Produced by Deuterium Synthesizers from atmospheric processing
- Base production: 10 units/hour at level 1
- Used for: Fleet fuel, advanced research, fusion reactor operation
- Scarcest resource, critical for fleet operations and expansion
- Production affected by planet temperature (colder = more efficient)

**Energy** - Utility resource powering operations
- Generated by Solar Plants and Fusion Reactors
- Not stored, consumed in real-time
- Powers: Building operations, research facilities, defensive systems
- Energy deficit reduces production efficiency across all facilities
