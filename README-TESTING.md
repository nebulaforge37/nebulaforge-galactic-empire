# Testing Phase Documentation

## Pre-Alpha Testing (Internal Development)

### Overview
Pre-Alpha testing focuses on core system functionality, database integrity, and basic game mechanics validation.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ installed
- PostgreSQL database access
- OpenAI API key for translation features
- Minimum 8GB RAM, 4GB available disk space

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure environment variables:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```
4. Initialize database: `npm run db:push`
5. Start development server: `npm run dev`

### Testing Scope
- **Core Systems**: User authentication, session management
- **Game Mechanics**: Resource generation, building construction, fleet management
- **Database Operations**: Data persistence, transaction integrity
- **AI Systems**: Faction behavior, combat calculations
- **Translation System**: Language detection, diplomatic translations

### Test Criteria
- All API endpoints respond within 2 seconds
- Database operations complete without errors
- User sessions persist across browser refreshes
- Real-time features update correctly via WebSocket
- No memory leaks during extended sessions

### Known Limitations
- Story mode system has initialization constraints
- Some UI components may display placeholder content
- Performance optimization pending for large fleets
- Translation accuracy varies by language complexity
